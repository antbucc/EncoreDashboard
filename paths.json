Throughout the sessions, students will learn to evaluate and utilize government data sources, understand the origin and structure of public databases, and develop indicator systems that support informed decision-making in public institutions.\n\nCombining theory with practice, the course offers in-person classes where students engage with theoretical presentations, key reading materials, case study analyses, and hands-on activities. Teaching tools will include multimedia presentations, instructional videos, and brainstorming sessions to encourage active comprehension. Students will have access to government open-data repositories, enabling real-time application of the concepts covered. Additionally, the course will integrate Open Educational Resources (OER) to enhance learning and analytical skills.\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be equipped to understand the application of information analysis systems in decision-making, evaluate data sources, and develop strategic indicators within public contexts\u2014fundamental skills for future careers in public administration and organizational management. This learning scenario aims to prepare students with essential competencies for a data-driven decision-making environment.\n\nIntegration of ENCORE:\nIn this course, the instructor will use the ENCORE platform to enrich course content with Open Educational Resources (OER) that complement practical, applied learning in information analysis for decision-making. Through ENCORE, the instructor will seek specific resources such as case studies, practical guides for creating indicators, and examples of data analysis in the public sector.\n\nENCORE will enable the instructor to plan and update the course with an open educational approach, ensuring that materials are accessible, relevant, and aligned with course objectives. Students will benefit from the variety of available resources, supporting autonomous learning and the practice of key skills like information analysis within open-data repositories, essential for their studies in Business Administration.",

Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes \u2013 which are basic units of information in the context of computer storage and processing.\n\nWhat is Information?\nInformation is processed, organised and structured data. It provides context for data and enables decision making. For example, a single customer\u2019s sale at a restaurant is data \u2013 this becomes information when the business is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ1\nWhat is data?

E.g., the information collected for writing a research paper is data until it is presented in an organized manner.\n\nQ2\nWhat is information?\nInformation is the processed, organized data that is beneficial in providing useful knowledge. For eg., the data compiled in an organized way in a research paper provides information about a particular concept/ topic.\n\nQ3\nWhat is valid information?\nValid information is something that is reliable. The information that has been checked and verified for a purpose is a valid information.\n\nQ4\nWhat are the different types of data?\nData can be of two types:\n\nQualitative data: It is non-numerical data.

The fluid movement of dance can be shown live via animation. Photos can be digitized using computers.\n\nScience and Engineering\nComputers with high performance are used to stimulate dynamic process in Science and Engineering. Supercomputers have numerous applications in area of Research and Development (R&D). Topographic images can be created through computers. Scientists use computers to plot and analyze data to have a better understanding of earthquakes.\n\nWhat do you mean by informatics?\nInformatics is the study, design, and development of information technology that generates, stores, processes, and presents information. Often, informatics is referred to as the science of information.",
